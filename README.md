# hello-world

I'm here to learn how to code in Python to allow me to change careers.
Being extremely negatively affected by the 2019-2020 caronavirus pandemic,
while being relatively unphased by the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis
has made me realise that I shouldn't just assume that my work prospects
in my current line of work will always be safe and secure. Instead I should
always be looking to improve my skillset, and be agile and adaptable in
the face of change. No matter what progressions or changed I make with my
GitHub profile, I shall always leave this repository here to serve as a
reminder to myself to never remain content when it comes to knowledge.
